To use the script have all of these on the same filesystem as your main system. So that hardlinks works. Be carefull that your editor does not destroy hardlinks

# included configs 

- bashrc
- emacs
-

### bashrc 

this is a none intrusiv bashrc and rather enhances your bashrc with my config instead of replacing it
